            Bruno Fernandes sends important message to Ten Hag after exit from
            Manchester United !
          </p>

          <p class="blog-list-p">
            Following Manchester United’s slow start to the 2024-25 Premier
            League season and failure to qualify for the UEFA Champions League,
            the club’s executives made the decision to part ways with Erik ten
            Hag. Two weeks after his departure, team captain Bruno Fernandes
            broke his silence, sharing his thoughts on the exit of the Dutch
            coach.
          </p>

          <p class="blog-list-p">
            Ten Hag was brought to United with a vision to rebuild the squad and
            had entrusted Fernandes with the captain’s armband, passing over
            players like Harry Maguire and Marcus Rashford. Reflecting on this,
            Fernandes expressed his gratitude in an interview with Sky Sports
            and addressed the team’s role in Ten Hag’s exit. “Whenever you see a
            manager go you have to take some of the blame on yourself, it is
            because the team is not doing so well,” Bruno stated. It is easier
            to get rid of a manager than 15 players. I spoke to the manager (Ten
            Hag) and apologized to him, I was disappointed he has gone and I
            tried to help him. I wasn’t scoring goals, we are not scoring goals
            and I feel responsible,” the captain added.

            What does Neymar's future hold? Santos president gives update on
            whether Al-Nassr superstar could return
          </p>

          <img src="images/neymar.jpg" />

          <p class="blog-list-p">
            As Santos prepares for the upcoming 2025 season, there is intense
            speculation about the possible return of one of Brazil’s most
            beloved stars—Neymar. While Neymar’s ongoing challenges in the Saudi
            Pro League at Al-Hilal raise doubts about his future, Santos
            President Marcelo Teixeira recently hinted at the potential for
            Neymar to come back to his roots. This has fueled excitement and
            mystery surrounding whether Santos will pursue a plan to bring the
            forward back home. Currently, the Peixe is navigating through
            significant roster changes and financial adjustments, including
            preliminary talks with former Santos player Gabigol. Although
            Neymar’s return is surrounded by mystery, Teixeira’s words have
            certainly kept fans on edge about what 2025 may hold.
          </p>

          <p class="blog-list-p">
            The Brazilian’s recent time at Al-Hilal has been fraught with
            setbacks. The 32-year-old forward moved from Paris Saint-Germain to
            Saudi Arabia in the summer of 2023, but the journey has been far
            from smooth. Not long after his arrival, he suffered a severe ACL
            injury while playing for Brazil, an injury that sidelined him for
            nearly a year. Though he briefly returned to the field this season,
            he soon suffered another setback, this time facing another
            four-to-six-week hiatus due to injury.

            Xabi Alonso will leave Bayer Leverkusen this summer: What will be
            his next destination?
          </p>

          <img src="images/xavi-future.jpg" />

          <p class="blog-list-p">
            According to Eurosport, Xabi Alonso will leave Bayer Leverkusen at
            the end of the current season, despite his contract running until
            2026. The report suggests Alonso’s next destination is likely Real
            Madrid, although Carlo Ancelotti still has 18 months remaining on
            his contract. The possibility of Alonso returning to Germany with
            Bayern Munich remains, however, particularly if Vincent Kompany
            underperforms this season. The report indicates that Alonso has
            already informed several Leverkusen players of his intention to
            depart at the end of the season. This decision may depend on
            Ancelotti’s continued tenure at Real Madrid.

            Premier League giants eye Rodrygo: €150M reportedly on the table for
            Real Madrid star
          </p>

          <p class="blog-list-p">
            Rodrygo Goes remains a highly sought-after player in the Premier
            League. Liverpool has shown the most significant interest, actively
            pursuing the 23-year-old Brazilian forward. However, they’re not
            alone; Manchester City is now making a strong push to acquire his
            services.
          </p>

          <p class="blog-list-p">
            According to Sport, Pep Guardiola‘s City has been monitoring Rodrygo
            for some time. Previously, the presence of established attacking
            players made a move unlikely. However, uncertainty surrounding
            Erling Haaland‘s future has prompted City to explore potential
            replacements. Haaland’s impact on Guardiola’s tactics means a change
            could necessitate a significant shift in strategy.
          </p>

          <p class="blog-list-p">
            City is prepared to make a substantial offer for Rodrygo. Real
            Madrid is considering a €150 million bid for the Brazilian.
